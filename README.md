This repo contains scripts related to Hbase. Specifically, how take an Hbase snapshot in HDFS, then read it into Hive for query and analysis. Compliments to Artem for putting together some tricks and tips on the <a href="https://community.hortonworks.com/articles/14806/working-with-hbase-and-hive-wip.html">Hortonworks Community page</a>, which I used as part of my script.
